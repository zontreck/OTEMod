Code Contributions

Asset contribution
----
2) Contributions are also accepted in the form of artwork or music, or sound, or block models from blockbench. Just simply follow the above steps to create your working base. Then send it to us in a pull request. No coding knowledge is necessary for adding these resources. Someone else can tackle that if you do not know how to code. An example of this is the Possum animal model in Thresholds. This was contributed by PossumTheWarrior via discord.

Bug reporting or feature requests
----
3) Bug reports. Please be as detailed as possible when reporting a bug. Include steps on how to reproduce the bug if possible.
4) Feature requests. Please be sure to name your issue ticket accordingly to indicate you are requesting a new feature, and not reporting a bug. Then be as detailed as possible in how you want the feature to work. If the feature is requested for LibZontreck. Please be detailed in how the API would work. You can do this simply by providing a basic interface example.
