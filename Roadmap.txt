* Dimension contents up in air
* Dimension will be timelocked, changes do not persist, and the world reverts itself after a period of time.
* Natural structures within the fractured dimension can be a refinery which can refine materials you mine in the realm
* Minerals not refined in the eternium dimension have a property where they will be destroyed from inventory if removed from dimension, and cannot be used in a normal crafting recipe.
* Dimension water acts like a fountain of youth
* As everything happening in the dimension canonically is happening all at once, the dimension will have a unique feature where server chat will not function
The player may also encounter other explorers, but they will be very glitched, their actions will make little sense, if they are mining, they may vanish into the ground like a ghost
The player cannot stay there too long as the ihan crystal charges will eventually run out
* Mekanism plugin machine: Skulk Extractor
    This machine will rip skulk blocks apart atom by atom to get every last drop of XP stored within and can charge a crystal, or convert it into a single use ihan crystal with a lesser charge.
* Adventure system with unique villager NPC that gives quests. This could be within the Eternium Dimension, or it could be from village to village. Rewards not yet determined.
